NORMALIZATION|SUBQUERIES

Why? removal of redundancy
1nf-atomic values

2nf-each row must have unique values and its not necessary to have primary key
-you must find a candidate key
and seperate cols(non key attributes) based on dependency to the key. and every table newly formed must have primary key and a foreign key relating everyone OR make a new table relationship with all the pks

3nf-avoid transitive dependencies
